Harvester to get Manuscript Images from Digitale Samlinger  
By Balduin Landolt (balduin.landolt@unibas.ch)

_LokaleSamlinger_ aims to easily access images from [Digitale Samlinger](http://digitalesamlinger.hum.ku.dk/). Of course, the images still belong to them.  
This program does nothing else, than to spare you some clicking work.  
Just think of it, as if you had downloaded the images manually.
